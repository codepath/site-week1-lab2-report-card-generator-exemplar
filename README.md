# Personal Website Exemplar Project
Exemplar code for personal website using HTML &amp; CSS

In this project you will create a personal website for someone else using HTML and CSS. A personal website is a great way for someone to showcase their work and introduce themselves to future employers. In this lab we will get you started with a skeleton layout of a website but you will have the opportunity to customize the website further with CSS styling. After exchanging websites, we highly encourage you to keep your website up to date with any new projects you create and elevate your website as you continue to build on your Full Stack knowledge throughout this course and beyond!
