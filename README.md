# Report Card Generator Lab

Your college has realized their report card generating system is broken! They've reached out to you to see if you'd be willing to help them fix it.

At the moment, they have the styling and general layout done, but they're missing valid JavaScript. Your job is to modify the `script.js` file with code that produces a working report card generator. They've sent over your grades for the year to use as a model.
